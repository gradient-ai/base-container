# Gradient Base Image

This repo houses a Dockerfile used to create an image used for Gradient runtimes. This image should be used for all Gradient runtimes, either solely or as the base layer for other images.
 
The goal of this image is to provide common packages for an advanced data science user that allows them to utilize the GPU hardware on Gradient. This image targets popular Machine Learning frameworks and includes packages commonly used for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks as well as general Data Science work.

## Software not included

Other software considered but not included.

The potential data science stack is far larger than any one person will use so we don't attempt to cover everything here.

Some generic categories of software not included:

 - Non-data-science software
 - Commercial software
 - Software not licensed to be used on an available VM template
 - Software only used in particular specialized data science subfields (although we assume our users probably want a GPU)

| Category           | Software | Why Not |
| -------------      | ------------- | ------------- |
| Apache             | Kafka, Parquet | |

| Deep Learning      | Caffe, Caffe2, Theano, PaddlePaddle, Chainer, MXNet | PyTorch and TensorFlow are dominant, rest niche |
| Deployment         | Dash, TFServing, R Shiny, Flask | Use Gradient Deployments |
| Distributed        | Horovod, OpenMPI | Use Gradient distributed |
| Feature store      | Feast | |
| Interpretability   | LIME/SHAP, Fairlearn, AI Fairness 360, InterpretML | |
| Languages          | R, SQL, Julia, C++, JavaScript, Python2, Scala | Python is dominant for data science |
| Monitoring         | Grafana | |
| NLP                | GenSim | |
| Notebooks          | Jupyter, Zeppelin | JupyterLab includes Jupyter notebook |
| Orchestrators      | Kubernetes | Use Gradient cluster|
| Partners           | fast.ai | Currently support a specific fast.ai runtime |
| Pipelines          | AirFlow, MLFlow, Intake, Kubeflow | |
| Python libraries   | statsmodels, pymc3, geopandas, Geopy, LIBSVM | Too many to attempt to cover |
| PyTorch extensions | Lightning | |
| R packages         | ggplot, tidyverse | Could add R if customer demand |
| Recommenders       | TFRS, scikit-surprise | |
| Scalable           | Dask, Numba, Spark 1 or 2, Koalas, Hadoop | |
| TensorFlow         | TF 1.15, Recommenders, TensorBoard, TensorRT | Could add TensorFlow 1.x if customer demand. Requires separate tensorflow-gpu for GPU support. |
